Hi! I'm BlueCyanMagentaGreenFan1137/19#5398 (but you can call me BCMGF1137).

This is my module, D. 

Module Description For Repository: "Interpret every serial number character as a digit in base-36, and then take the sum of those digits in decimal."

I recently found out that the module "The Calculator" had the exact same concept so I'm gonna buff D later this month to make it more original...

Special thanks to GhostSalt, Hawker, and SerialDesignationF for helping me in the creating process of this module!
