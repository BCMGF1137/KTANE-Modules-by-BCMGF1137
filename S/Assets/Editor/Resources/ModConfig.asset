    Determine a sequence colored buttons to press over 3 stages with increasingly
    complicated steps.

    I intended to release this on August 1 of 2025 but it took a while to optimize
    the mod.


    To be fair though, most of my manuals from 2024 were way too tedious, and I was
    recently warned about the concept of "objectively bad modules". I mean, I hope
    that this module isn''t *too* bad (but it probably is)...


    I made the sounds in FL Studio Mobile. Oh yeah, and I didn''t forget about TP
    support.


    Enjoy this module (it''s the lengthiest one I''ve made so far)!


    Last thing, this is the 2nd time I had to upload a mod before going somewhere
    on vacation. (Ironically, the first time was with the other one-letter mod I made,
    D.)'
